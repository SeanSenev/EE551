EE551

This repo is dedicated for the Final EE551 Project for Sean Seneviratne and Akul Agarwal.

The Jupyter Notebook included provides a portfolio optimization algorithm that manages the input 
capital that a user provides. It implements a classical portfolio optimization model derived from
the Markowitz Model(1966). In addition, it incorporates a quantum-optmized portfolio model sourced
from the IBM-Q (Quantum computer).
